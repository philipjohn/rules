Have power over your WordPress site. No coding required.

== Description ==

Rules for WordPress finally gives you control over your site by allowing you to directly affect what plugins and themes can and can't do.

Not only that but it allows you to create your own plugin-style functionality without an ounce of code required.

Finally, it provides other plugins the ability to add additional actions that you can carry out using Rules.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
